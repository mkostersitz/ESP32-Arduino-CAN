# Arduino Library for the ESP32 CAN Bus (ESP32-Arduino-CAN)
## Why forking it
The original project has not seen movement in a few years. Some dependencies are being deprecated.
Need a more up to date version of the code.

## Features

* Support the CAN Bus from the ESP32 (SJA1000)
* CAN Messages send and receive 
* Various Bus speeds
* Standard and Extended Frames
* CAN Message Filter
